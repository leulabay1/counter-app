# Counter App

this simple app demonstrates how React hooks should be use 
    in the app I have use useState hook to intialize a counter state to re-Render the app while it's value is being updated 
    I have used the useEffect hook to update the value of the documnet title with the counter as it's dependancy
    and I have used the useRef to locate the button and focus on the button when it's clicked
